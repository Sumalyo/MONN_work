To run the code, load the Jupyter Notebook [Memristor_Tasks.ipynb](https://github.com/Sumalyo/MONN_work/blob/main/Memristor_Tasks.ipynb) with the Python code in a Python 3.x environment like Google Colab or any other compatible environment.  Running all cells in the notebook will install the necessary dependencies and plot the required graphs.
